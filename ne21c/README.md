## NE21c - A C++ port of NE2001

This directory holds a C++ port of the NE2001 FORTRAN code. 
It was generated using the `f2c` utility, after some minor
changes to the order of statements in the FORTRAN code to
make it compliant with the F77 standard that `f2c` expects.

The NE2001 code is contained in `ne21.c,` and is ANSI C. 
This was generated by running

    cat *.f | f2c > ne21.c

Note the *.f exclude the main utility, `NE2001.f`. 
To compile the main command line utility,

    cc -o NE2001 NE2001.c ne21.c -lf2c -lm
